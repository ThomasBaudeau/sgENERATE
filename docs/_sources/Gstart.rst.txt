Getting Started
================

For installation see `Installing <https://thomasbaudeau.github.io/sgENERATE/installing.html>`_ documentation.

simple run : ::

   sgENERATE
   
Option:
~~~~~~~ 

command option :
 
* ``-h`` or ``--help`` The help page in command line.
* ``--coverage``. The coverage of the generated sample. The default value is ``--coverage 5000``. 

exemple : ::

   sgENERATE --coverage 1000 

.. NOTE::

   Value bigger than **99** expected

* ``--error`` The mean error rate of the generated sample. The default value is ``--error 0.95`` (5% mean error rate) . 

exemple : ::

   sgENERATE --error 0.85

.. NOTE::

   Value are expected between and **0.70** **0.96**. The generation is based on pbsim2 and read better than 4% are not possible.


* ``--compare`` Option to enable comparison between periscope and periscope_multi. The default value is ``--compare True``.If the user only want to generate a sample use --false 

exemple : ::

   sgENERATE --compare False

.. NOTE::

   Value bigger than **99** expected
   
* ``--real`` Option to enable comparison between periscope and periscope_multi on a provided dataset (holds up the generation of a generated samples). The default value is ``--real False``

exemple : ::

   sgENERATE --real True

.. NOTE::

   The option **must** be used with ``--fastq``

   
* ``--fastq`` path to provided sample 

exemple : ::

   sgENERATE --fastq PATH/tofile.fastq

.. NOTE::

   The option **must** be used with ``--real True``


Other option:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

.. WARNING::

   These options have been designed to allow further testing during the paper writing process. They will not be maintained in future developments and may no longer work.

* ``--tool`` option to make the comparaison with other mapper for periscope_multi (graphmap, bwa-mem or minimap2 with refined parameters)
* ``--technology`` option to make the comparaison with other mapper on illumina data (illumina,ont)
* ``--mode`` option to extract all non canonical sgRNA in ``result/non_COV_cano.fasta`` use ``--mode extraction``
